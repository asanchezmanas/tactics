# Tactics: UI/UX Blueprint & Views

The Tactics interface is designed as a **Command Console**, not a reporting tool. It is built to facilitate decision-making in under 5 seconds.

## 1. Visual Language: "Sobriedad"
- **Theme**: Dark Mode (Tactics Night) for high technical density.
- **Aesthetic**: Glassmorphism, premium micro-animations, and high-fidelity charts.
- **Philosophy**: Precision over Persuasion. Minimal marketing fluff.

## 2. The Command Dashboard (Overview)
The central hub for data-driven decisions.
- **The Golden Metric**: `LTV-ROAS` vs. `Traditional ROAS`. Displays the hidden value of current marketing efforts.
- **Capital at Risk Radar**: High-visibility indicator of potential churn among VIP customers.
- **Budget Simulator (Pro)**: Interactive slider to simulate ROI based on different channel allocations.
- **AI Insights Feed**: A curated list of 3 actionable prescriptions generated by the core engines.

## 3. Specialized Views
### A. Customer Intelligence (CRM 2.0)
- **Predictive Explorer**: List of customers ranked by **Future Value (LTV)** rather than historical spend.
- **Ficha Vital**: Individual customer view showing their "Predicted Next Purchase" date and churn probability.
- **Action Triggers**: One-click exports to Meta Custom Audiences or Klaviyo lists.

### B. Marketing Mix Explorer (MMM Deep Dive)
- **Saturation Curves**: Visual representations of the "Efficiency Ceiling" for each paid channel.
- **Attribution Audit**: Comparison between traditional "Last Click" metrics and Bayesian true contribution.
- **Channel Fatigue**: Predictive indicators of when a channel will stop being profitable at the current spending rate.

### C. Budget Sandbox (Scenario Planner)
- **"What If" Mode**: Create and save scenarios (e.g., "Black Friday Surge" or "Exit Facebook").
- **Proyected Output**: Instant calculation of projected Revenue, CAC, and Net Profit for each scenario.

### D. The Profit Matrix (Unit Economics Explorer)
- **Bundle Efficiency Map**: A matrix showing which product combinations yield the highest "Net Margin."
- **Deadstock Alert**: Highlighting products with high storage costs and low velocity, with suggested bundle "rescues."
- **Offer Simulator**: A tool to model how a "Buy 2 Get 1" vs. a "20% Discount" impacts the bottom line.

## 4. Connections & Health
- **Connector Pulse**: Real-time status of Shopify, Meta, and Google Ads APIs.
- **Logic Log**: Transparency audit showing exactly when and how many transactions were processed by the Bayesian engines.
