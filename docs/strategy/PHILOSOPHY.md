# Tactics: Philosophy & Core Values

Tactics is not just a data tool; it is the **"Marketing Brain"** for discerning companies. Our philosophy is rooted in European standards of precision, sobriety, and long-term value.

## 1. Vision: Precision over Persuasion
In a world of flashy dashboards and "vanity metrics," Tactics stands for **German-style sobriety**. We do not use "marketing fluff." Every insight is backed by robust Bayesian machinery and probabilistic models.

## 2. Business Impact: Investment, Not Expense
Marketing software is often viewed as a cost center. Tactics flips this narrative:
- **Prescriptive Analytics**: We don't just tell you what happened (Descriptive); we tell you what to do (Prescriptive).
- **LTV-ROAS**: We optimize for the future. Instead of looking at immediate ROAS, we look at the predicted 12-month value of every euro spent.
- **Capital Efficiency**: We ensure that every cent is allocated to the channel or customer that generates the highest long-term margin.

## 3. The Pillars of the Project
- **Simplicity**: Complex science delivered through an interface that a CEO can understand in 5 seconds.
- **Robustness**: Using models from Stanford and Wharton (BG/NBD, Gamma-Gamma) to ensure predictions are grounded in mathematical truth.
- **Actionability**: Data is useless without action. Every view includes a "Trigger" (Export to Meta, Sync to Klaviyo, Rescue VIP).

## 5. Market Context & Pricing
Tactics addresses the "Cookie Crisis" and the inefficiency of "Last Click" attribution by providing a Bayesian "Cerebro Financiero."

### Comparison vs. Competition
- **Klaviyo/Shopify**: Limited "Black Box" predictions. Tactics offers transparency and custom Bayesian intervals.
- **Northbeam/Triple Whale**: High performance but often prohibitively expensive for mid-market agencies. Tactics focuses on extreme simplification and high-fidelity decisions for humans.
