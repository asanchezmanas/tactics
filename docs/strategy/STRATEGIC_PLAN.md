# Unified Strategic Plan v2.0

> **Focus**: Capital Compounding & Architecture Stability
> **Status**: Consolidated V2 Documentation

This document unifies the project vision with the financial scaling roadmap, focusing on building a world-class AI infrastructure for e-commerce.

## 1. Project Vision
Tactics is the "Strategic Brain" for modern e-commerce. We provide deep predictive intelligence (LTV, Churn, MMM) that was previously only available to giant enterprises, now accessible via a maintainable and scalable V2 architecture.

## 2. Financial Philosophy: "The Compounding Engine"

Tactics operates on a **Growth First** model. Since personal income is covered, 100% of net profit is reinvested into the system.

### Account Allocation Rules
- **Tax (15%)**: Compliance.
- **OPEX (20%)**: Lean operations and server infrastructure.
- **Growth (40%)**: Aggressive Customer Acquisition (CAC).
- **Treasury (25%)**: The "War Chest" for market dominance and acquisitions.

## 4. Treasury Strategy (Liquidity Management)

- **Income (40%)**: Dividend Aristocrats (covers OpEx).
- **Growth (40%)**: Tech indices (compounds faster than inflation).
