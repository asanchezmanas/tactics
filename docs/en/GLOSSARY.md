# Tactics Glossary: Intelligence 2.0

This document centralizes and clarifies all technical and strategic terminology used in the Tactics platform. Designed to be accessible for both business and technical profiles.

---

## A
### Adstock (Advertising Memory)
The residual effect that an advertisement has on the consumer's mind after being seen. In Tactics, we measure how "yesterday's" spend continues to generate sales "today."

### Bayesian Algorithm
A statistical method that uses prior knowledge (history, industry trends) to improve current predictions. Unlike traditional statistics, it "learns" and adjusts as new data arrives.

### Attention Layers
A Neural Network technology that allows the AI to "focus" on the most important events in a customer's history (e.g., a high-value purchase) while ignoring irrelevant noise.

## B
### Basket Affinity
The analysis of which products are purchased together most frequently. It helps discover opportunities for "bundles" or joint promotions.

## C
### Churn (Customer Attrition Rate)
The percentage of customers who stop buying from your store. In Tactics, we calculate the **Churn Probability** so you can act before the customer leaves.

### CLV / LTV (Customer Lifetime Value)
The total economic value a customer will bring to your company throughout their entire relationship with you. It is the flagship metric of Tactics.

### Cooldown
Mandatory waiting time between AI model re-trainings to prevent the system from overreacting to temporary fluctuations.

### CAC Efficiency (Acquisition Efficiency)
The ability to attract new customers at the lowest possible cost. Tactics optimizes CAC by analyzing which channels bring customers with the highest LTV, not just the cheapest ones.

### CAC / LTV Ratio
The relationship between what it costs you to acquire a customer and what that customer generates for you. A healthy ratio (e.g., 1:3 or higher) is a sign of a scalable business.

## D
### Deep Synthesis
The ability of Tactics Intelligence 2.0 to cross-reference multiple data layers (sales, stock, advertising) to generate a single high-level strategic conclusion.

### Drift (Data Drift)
When your customers' behavior patterns change drastically (e.g., due to an external crisis or a change in season), making the old model no longer accurate. Tactics detects this automatically.

## G
### Gateway Product
That product which, when it is a customer's first purchase, maximizes the probability of that customer becoming a high-LTV recurring buyer.

## I
### Intelligence 2.0
The generation of Tactics algorithms that integrates Deep Learning, Algorithmic Transparency, and Multi-Variable Synthesis.

### iROAS (Incremental ROAS)
An estimate of how much real return the last euro invested in advertising generated, helping to detect if a channel is saturated.

## L
### Lift (Association Strength)
A metric that indicates how much more likely two products are to be purchased together compared to if they were purchased independently. A Lift of 2.0 means the combination occurs twice as much as expected.

### LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
A type of Artificial Intelligence specialized in understanding temporal sequences. Tactics uses it to predict when a customer will buy again based on their past intervals.

## M
### MMM (Marketing Mix Modeling)
A mathematical technique to understand how each marketing channel contributes to total sales, even those that don't have a direct "click" (such as TV or Radio).

## P
### Pareto (80/20 Rule)
The phenomenon where a small portion of your customers (20%) generates the vast majority of your revenue (80%). Tactics audits this risk to avoid your business depending on too few people.

### POAS (Profitability Over Ad Spend)
Unlike ROAS (which only looks at revenue), POAS looks at the **real profit** generated by each euro invested in advertising, discounting the cost of products (COGS).

## R
### Reinforcement Reasons
Human-language explanations that accompany each AI prediction, justifying why the algorithm has decided to adjust a value (e.g., "adjusted upwards due to a positive retention signal").

### ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)
Total revenue divided by advertising investment. A fundamental but secondary metric compared to POAS in Intelligence 2.0.
