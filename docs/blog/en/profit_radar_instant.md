# The Profitability Radar: How to see what others ignore in their data

In today's digital marketing ecosystem, we don't lack information. On the contrary, we are drowning in it. But there is a huge difference between having "data" and having "intelligence."

Most e-commerce businesses operate by looking in the rearview mirror: how much did we spend yesterday? what was the Meta ROAS? how many orders came in? While these metrics are necessary, they are insufficient to navigate a market where the cost per acquisition (CAC) continues to rise.

This is where Tactics' **Profitability Radar** comes in.

## Beyond ROAS: iROAS and POAS
ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) is a misleading metric. It ignores product costs (COGS), shipping expenses, and, most importantly, long-term customer loyalty.

Our Intelligence 2.0 introduces **POAS (Profit on Ad Spend)**. It doesn't tell you how much money you "moved," but how much money you actually *earned* after all variable costs. A channel can have a ROAS of 4.0 but be losing money if the product margin is low, while another with a ROAS of 2.5 could be the real engine of your net profit.

## Detecting "Gateway Products"
Do you know which specific product, upon being the first purchase, guarantees that a customer will return three times more than the average?

Traditionally, this required weeks of cohort analysis in Excel. Tactics does it instantly. We identify your **Gateway Products** (entry products): those that act as a loyalty magnet. Once detected, your acquisition strategy changes completely: you stop selling "whatever" to sell "what builds the future of your company."

## Basket Affinity: The Psychology of the Order
Why are product A and product B purchased together with a "Lift" of 3.5x? Tactics detects these micro-correlations that often go unnoticed by the human eye. These affinities are not just statistical curiosities; they are the basis for creating high-converting **bundles** (packs) and post-sale emails that truly resonate with the customer.

## Transparent AI: Why we made this decision
AI should not be a "black box." At Tactics, every recommendation is accompanied by a **Reinforcement Reason**. If we suggest lowering the budget on Google Ads, we will tell you exactly why: maybe we have detected that this channel has reached its saturation point or that the quality of customers captured there has a decreasing LTV (Lifetime Value).

## Conclusion: The value of the first step
You don't need a team of data engineers or months of integration. The value of Tactics lies in its ability to illuminate the dark areas of your business immediately.

The real profitability is not in selling more, but in selling better, to the right customers and with the products that build a sustainable brand.
