# Causal Attribution: The End of "Simple Correlation" in Marketing

In the age of data excess, the greatest risk for a manager is not the lack of information, but the misinterpretation of it. For years, digital marketing has lived under the dogma of correlation: "if channel A spent more and sales went up, channel A is responsible."

For the most mature and demanding markets—where every dollar must be justified by structural logic—this approach is, quite simply, insufficient.

## The Mirage of the "Last Click"
Traditional attribution metrics often suffer from a myopia bias. They ignore that marketing does not occur in a vacuum, but in an ecosystem of synergies. A television commercial or a social media video may not generate a direct sale, but it is the fuel that feeds direct searches on Google days later.

Confusing this sequence with "luck" or attributing all the merit to the search engine is a strategic mistake that leads to divesting in the channels that actually feed your growth.

## Entering the Era of Synergy 2.0
At Tactics, we have evolved the concept of attribution into what we call the **Synergy Matrix 2.0**. We do not look for correlations; we look for **lagged causality**.

Our mathematical model identifies the "Echo Effect":
1.  **Lagged Interactions**: We measure how the impact of one channel affects the efficiency of another with a delay of days or weeks.
2.  **Resilience Testing**: The system analyzes periods of silence and spending spikes to understand the business's real "Baseline" (sales that would occur without advertising).
3.  **Causality Isolation**: We separate success due to seasonality from success due to tactical execution.

## Why Mathematical Sobriety is your best Asset
For the European market, stability is the new growth. We do not look for temporary "hacks," but for an investment architecture that resists volatility.

By understanding causal synergy, you not only optimize today's return (ROAS); you ensure the health of your brand's ecosystem for the next five years. Because in a sophisticated market, the one who best understands the collaboration between their pieces is the one who ends up dominating the board.
