# The Opportunity Cost of Intuition: Why "Gut Feeling" is No Longer Enough

In 2024 e-commerce, relying exclusively on entrepreneurial "gut feeling" is a high-risk strategy. Although intuition brought many brands to their first 100k, it is the same thing that usually stalls them before the million mark.

## What would happen if you don't have this information?

Without precise data such as LTV (Lifetime Value) or real CAC per channel, your company operates in a state of **permanent uncertainty**:

1. **Inefficient Investment**: You are spending on channels that bring volume but not profitability. Without knowing who your high-value customer is, you treat everyone the same, losing margin on every "cheap acquisition."
2. **Phantom Growth**: Your revenue goes up, but your cash goes down. It's the classic symptom of scaling without understanding unit costs or retention.
3. **Vulnerability**: A change in Meta's algorithm or a supply crisis can sink your business because you don't know which levers to pull to maintain the margin.

## Why use the information gathered?

Tactics Intelligence 2.0 doesn't just give you numbers; it gives you **strategic optionality**:

- **Identify the "Gateway Product"**: Knowing exactly which product your best customer enters with allows you to optimize your entire acquisition funnel towards long-term profitability.
- **Churn Prediction**: Detecting when a customer is about to leave *before* it happens gives you the opportunity to intervene with personalized offers, saving thousands of euros in lost sales.
- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: You no longer choose between "selling more" or "spending less." Our MMM models tell you exactly how to balance both to maximize cash flow.

Information is the life insurance for your scaling. Scaling without intelligence is simply betting your company's future on luck.
